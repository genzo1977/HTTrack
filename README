Usage: HTTrack <Absolute URL> 

HTTrack parses the URL argument to find the host name. 
i.e. HTTrack https://ogscanada.ca/products.html 

host_name: ogscanada.ca
path_name: /products.html

The overall goal of this is to test URL's with basic structure.  In doing
so, mirror the web site by producing an identical directory structure to
the one maintained by the original website.  All documents referenced in
the initial HTML document of the "remote" server will be downloaded.  For 
simplicity sake this assumes a rather simplistic initial loading of hyperlinks
of the form: <a href="[http://host_name/]path_name">some text</a>.

After cloning a simple "remote" site and its structure, we are able to launch
a very basic web server which allows our mirrored site to be accessed through
the internet.  The web server is setup only to handle GET requests.  The following
status codes are set up:
* 200 OK
* 400 Bad Request
* 404 Not Found

If the requested HTML file does not exist on the local server, a "Not Found" error
is returned.  Otherwise, an HTTP OK message is retured along with the simplified
version of the requested file. Another goal of the web server is the ability to 
handle more than one request 
simultaneously.

Usage: WebServer <Port>

The web server is called "WebServer" and takes one argument that specifies the port
number at which the server should be listening for incoming requests: 
i.e. WebServer 80
